			<h2><a href="">Bank of America using Private Intel Firms to Attack Wikileaks</a></h2>
			<span class="timestamp">2011-02-09</span>
			<p>In a document titled "The WikiLeaks Threat" three data intelligence companies, Plantir Technologies, HBGary Federal and Berico Technologies, outline a plan to attack Wikileaks. They are acting upon request from Hunton and Williams, a law firm working for Bank of America. The Department of Justice recommended the law firm to Bank of America according to <a href="http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/201106/6798/Data-intelligence-firms-proposed-a-systematic-attack-against-WikiLeaks" class='spip_out' rel='external'>an article in The Tech Herald</a>. The prosed attacks on WikiLeaks according to the slides include these actions:</p>

<ul class="spip"><li> <strong>Feed the fuel between the feuding groups</strong>. Disinformation. Create messages around actions of sabotage or discredit the opposing organizations. 	Submit fake documents and then call out the error. </li><li> <strong>Create concern over the security of the infrastructure</strong>. Create exposure 	stories. If the process is believed not to be secure they are done.</li><li> <strong>Cyber attacks against the infrastructure to get data on document	submitters</strong>. This would kill the project. Since the servers are now 	in Sweden and France putting a team together to get access is more straightforward.</li><li> <strong>Media campaign to push the radial and reckless nature of WikiLeaks activities</strong>. Sustain pressure. Does nothing for the fanatics, but creates concern and doubt among moderates.</li><li> <strong>Search for leaks</strong>. Use social media to profile and identify risky behavior of employees. </li></ul>

			<span class="timestamp">2010-10-22</span>
			<p>The 391,832 reports (&#8217;The Iraq War Logs&#8217;), document the war and occupation in Iraq, from 1st January 2004 to 31st December 2009 (except for the months of May 2004 and March 2009) as told by soldiers in the United States Army. Each is a &#8217;SIGACT&#8217; or Significant Action in the war. They detail events as seen and heard by the US military troops on the ground in Iraq and are the first real glimpse into the secret history of the war that the United States government has been privy to throughout.</p>

			<h2><a href="http://www.collateralmurder.com/">Video: Collateral Murder</a></h2>
			<span class="timestamp">2010-04-05</span>
			<p>WikiLeaks has released a classified US military video depicting the indiscriminate slaying of over a dozen people in the Iraqi suburb of New Baghdad &mdash; including two Reuters news staff. Reuters has been trying to obtain the video through the Freedom of Information Act, without success since the time of the attack. The video, shot from an Apache helicopter gun-sight, clearly shows the unprovoked slaying of a wounded Reuters employee and his rescuers. Two young children involved in the rescue were also seriously wounded.</p>
